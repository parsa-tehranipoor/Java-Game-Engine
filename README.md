# Java-Game-Engine
This is a project that me and my friend Daniel Wang started back in January 2023 and worked on up until May 2024. It's a mostly functional game engine written in Java with its own syntax and organization developed by us. Their are some demos of very minature games and levels attached to showcase the functionality of the game engines many features. We had grander plans in mind as we had hoped to complete a game as well in our given time frame however, we unfortunately were not able to and thus you may find figments of code centered around a game called "Tomhopper" in this game engine code. 

This game engine does not have the same capabilites as modern day game engines such as unreal engine and unity, but it does include many features and structures to mess around with. Small, mostly indie type genre games are most likely this game engines strong suits with local multiplayer as an option as well. Also, another important note is that the graphics(the locations where we have hardcoded images or objects) were stylized towards our own computers while working on this project. Thus, running the program at first might create a screen with objects offscreen and not centered. We recommend that you change the coordinates on your own by looking through the 'Segments' package and changing them.
